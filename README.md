### Never take your eyes off the game

==========

### Announcement: After April 25, 2017, DiceStream will no longer work on Google Hangouts.  A key API is being removed by Google, rendering DiceStream inoperable on the service.

DiceStream is an dice rolling app for video chat services that displays rolled dice as overlays on a user's video screen.  Other dice rollers display their results in a common chat window that only participents in the chat can see.  DiceStream's dice allow people watching the chat on a stream to see the dice rolls at the same time as the players in the game.
